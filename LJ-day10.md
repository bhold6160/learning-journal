The past couple days we have been learning SQL and postgres which has been extremely difficult. I'm having a very hard time getting the syntax down. Which is to be expected with learning any new language. I did however really enjoy watching the 401 grads give their presentations. It's exciting to see just how refined our skills will be by the time we finish here. It's also really great to see just how supportive all the community here at Code Fellows is. Really excited for what the future holds!
