Today we starting learning functional programming, which on top of learning SQL is really making my head spin. There is alot of new syntax to get down to understand these two languages and how they work. I'm struggling to find the questions to even ask during lecture. I'm hoping the upcoming lectures and lab assignments will help clarify these subjects for me. I have however started getting some really good information put together for my blog post and since I'm doing it on which stack to choose here at Code Fellows, It's giving me some great insight for myself as to which direction I would like to go.
