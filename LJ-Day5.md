On Friday we learned about using handlebars which at first seemed really challenging to reformat my code to implement it but once I was able to get everything working, it was easy to see just how useful that will be to use in the future. Ending week one I am feeling much more comfortable than I did when i started 201. It's such a good feeling being able to look at code and actually be able to some-what know what I'm looking at, instead of it looking like a foreign language.
