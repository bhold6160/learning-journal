Today we have been learning about routing controllers. Which for me has been very straight forward and welcome concept after trying to learn SQL and functional programming. I feel like this program has the prefect balance of "holy shit how am i ever supposed to understand this"? and then hit us with a simpler concept which gives us a little confidence booster to keep us motivated to move forward. However, I do wish we could have spent a little more time learning SQL earlier on instead of a quick crash course right before finals week but since this is only a 4 week course I understand the difficulties of that.
