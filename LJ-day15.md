Today we did a review of everything we've learned so far in 301. This was extremely helpful going over each concept and working with examples to make sure we have a good understanding. I definitely had a few a ha! moments especially going over functional programming and how to properly use the different array methods. I have really enjoyed this class and I excited to begin this new chapter into 401 with all the knowledge I've learned here.
