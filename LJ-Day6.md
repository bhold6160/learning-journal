Today we started to learn about AJAX and some more on JSON. I definitely need to do some more studying on these subjects but so far my understanding is that AJAX is using the server to continually update the data being displayed on your web page where as JSON is storing that data for later use. There was alot of information thrown at us on Monday so I'm still trying to let all that soak in. Looking forward to learn about how the server side of things work.
