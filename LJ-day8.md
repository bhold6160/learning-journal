Today we learned about creating and using databases. We practice creating tables with postgres which is pretty straight forward as far as commands go, but as with each language we are introduced to it's going to take some time before it actually starts to make sense. Working on the lab today and commenting about what each function is doing was helpful. Although I'm still understanding the full-stack cycle and CRUD. I will continue to ask questions so I can gain more understanding of all these concepts.
