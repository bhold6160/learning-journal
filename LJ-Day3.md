# LJ Code 301 - Day 3
Today we learned how to handle on click events using jQuery which seems much more efficient than using vanilla javascript which is nice. We also learned about how to select different elements on the page by targeting parent elements or selecting a specific attribute. I found learning about different animations to be the most interesting, it's really cool seeing all the ways you can manipulate the page with just a couple lines of code. Starting 301 has definitely been challenging and I really don't feel like I'm understanding jQuery all that well yet so I'm hoping to just sit down this weekend and practice everything we've learned throughout this week.
